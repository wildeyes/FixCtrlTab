# Ctrl Tab Fix Sublime Text Plugin
----------------------------------
I got tired of `fixing` Sublime Text on each machine I installed it on, so I made this.

This adds 
```

    { "keys": ["ctrl+tab"], "command": "next_view" },
    { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+tab"], "command": "prev_view" }

```
to your keybindings, making ctrl tab work like expected.
